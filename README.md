# Nerf-Mods
This is a place where I put in different mods for Nerf Blasters

Note:
The mods that are in there blasters folder, (Such as the Modulus ECS-10), will only work with the blaster model labeled.
Mods in the Universal Folder are designs that I think that will work with ever blaster, (ALWAYS CONFERM AND NOTHING IN HERE IS SERTAIN).

Tools that I use,
EasyEDA Schematic and PCB IDE
Fusion 360
Visual Studio Code
etc...
